**ItalianSigns** is a dataset that includes images of road contexts captured using a smartphone camera with a resolution of 1280x720 (HD). All the images were taken in the Reggio Emilia province of Italy. This dataset consists of 362 labeled images, and each image showcases a road *sign*, specifically those related to speed limits. It also includes annotations for the speed limit number and a bounding box outlining the Region of Interest (ROI) containing the sign.

To locate and extract the bounding boxes around the signs, the authors utilized the HoughCircles method. In addition, they employed a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to analyze feature vectors extracted using SIFT between the ground truth images and the regions of interest in the inference images.
